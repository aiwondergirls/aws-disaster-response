## Challenges we faced
-

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Training an AI model for aiding relief efforts to Earthquake disaters by predicting the affected poulation.
- Building an Application User interface with Streamlit and Python.
- Allowing people to query disaster related details through NLP reports. 

And participating in the Hackathon!

## The pillars of our project
TBAdded

**Innovation:** The application and inference pipeline are built with standard *REST APIs* and *opensource libraries* frameworks which can integrate well with the existing AI models currently in use. Thus significantly improving the integration of AI into disaster response systems and enhancing the benefits the diasaster affected population. The possible identification of high-affected populations, the application will allow Relief agencies to aid and support to the most needy, saving more lives.

**Impact:** 
TDAdded. 

**Implementation:** The application uses Python, Fastapi, Streamlit, fpdf libraries. The model is trained, optimized, and performs with an accuracy of X% on the validation dataset.  

**Feasibility:** The UI application, model are built with python, REST APIs and opensource libraries, frameworks. 

**Extendibility:** One can use the application for other types of disaters such as  Cyclones, and  Fires and can be integrated well with Relief efforts.
